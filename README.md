Arcade game requirements.

## Instructions

This game is based on the classic Frogger arcade game.

The main goal of this game is to move the player through a virtual board (generator by canvas) which allows us to interact with the different pieces that compose it.
That is to say the enemies (cockroaches) and the player itself, to be able to interact and move the player we will use the keys up / right / left / down of our keyboard.

Once the player manages to reach the top (the water) the game will inform us of the different levels that we are going through with a modal and an informative text on the top.

* In order to carry out this game they have needed several skills of js, html and css.
  They are the following:

    * Object-Oriented JavaScript,
    * constructor functions to create multiple Enemy instances,
    * prototypal inheritance,
    * HTML5 Canvas API,
    * resource loading via immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE)

In future improvements it is planned to add different levels of difficulty and different prizes that the user will achieve by including items on the canvas.
